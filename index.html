                    The European Organization for Nuclear Research, known as CERN (derived from the name 
                    <i>Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire</i>), is a European research organization that operates the 
                    largest particle physics laboratory in the world. Established in 1954, the organization is based in a 
                    northwest suburb of Geneva on the Franco–Swiss border and has 23 member states.
                    Israel is the only non-European country granted full membership. CERN is an official United Nations Observer.
                    <br><br>
                    The acronym CERN is also used to refer to the laboratory, which in 2019 had 2,660 scientific, technical, 
                    and administrative staff members, and hosted about 12,400 users from institutions in more than 70 countries.
                    In 2016 CERN generated 49 petabytes of data.
                    <br><br>
                    CERN's main function is to provide the particle accelerators and other infrastructure needed for high-energy 
                    physics research – as a result, numerous experiments have been constructed at CERN through international 
                    collaborations. CERN is the site of the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), the world's largest and highest-energy 
                    particle collider.The main site at Meyrin hosts a large computing facility, which is primarily used to store 
                    and analyse data from experiments, as well as simulate events. Researchers need remote access to these facilities,
                    so the lab has historically been a major wide area network hub. 
                    CERN is also the birthplace of the World Wide Web.

                <h2>Top 5 fun facts</h2>

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        An LHC collision of two lead nuclei creates a searing quark-gluon plasma - 
                        a primordial soup of fundamental particles as hot as 4 trillion degrees - 
                        about 200,000 times hotter than the core of the Sun.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        LHC magnets use superconducting niobium-titanium cables. 
                        Each contains thousands of filaments 0.007 mm thick - about 1/10 of the diameter of a human hair. 
                        Laid end to end, the filaments would stretch to the Sun and back more than five times (1.7 billion km).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The LHC is the world's largest fridge. It's 36,000 tonnes of magnets are cooled to 1.9 K 
                        (-271.3 degrees C). That's colder than outer space. This needs 120 tonnes of superfluid helium,
                        10,000 tonnes of liquid nitrogen, 40 MW of electricity and 40,000 leak-tight pipe seals.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Protons circuit the LHC 11,245 times per second. 
                        It takes on average 10 hours before they collide with other protons. 
                        On their way, they travel more than 10 billion kilometres - 
                        the distance to Neptune and back.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        CERN's antiproton decelerator can make 100 billion antiprotons (0.1 picogram) a day. 
                        The low-energy antiprotons can be captured in Penning traps, but contrary to the movie Angels & Demons, 
                        it'd take billions of years to make and store a gram of antimatter.
                    </li>
